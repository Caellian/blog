I was helping a friend prepare for a job interview recently, and we got to the
"What's your biggest flaw?" question. This question is hard to answer for most
people because it's very effective at narrowing down the pool of candidates.

The friend heard advice that they should answer with a strength masked as a
flaw. However, I question that strategy because an experienced HR professional
will likely see right through it. The traits they'll gauge from such an answer
depend on them, but it can vary from "prepared" to "coached" or "reserved"; or
they can treat the answer as "you'll find out once you hire me", which isn't
great either.

The truth is that the vast majority of job applicants they interview (if not
all) are human. Even the non-human ones are flawed, and answering that question
genuinely can help the applicant build their rapport, show maturity and openness
to feedback, both of which are crucial for most roles.

All applicants want to present themselves in the best light possible, so
answering the question that gives you most sway to stand out with a response
that tells the interviewer to kindly mind their own business is not the best
choice. You should avoid generic and vague responses at all costs.

This question is also the opposite of the "What's your biggest strength?" one,
but both are asking the _same thing_ - they're just framed differently to allow
the candidate to describe their
[**self-concept**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) and **values**.
[Dual framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)) makes
it easier for the candidate to showcase both traits they're proud of and those
they view as negative (although not necessarily so, depending on the extent).
The qualities you refer to are all your own; which side you attribute them to
merely gives insight into where your values lie.

The answer gives insight into the candidate **self-awareness**, **emotional
intelligence**, and **authenticity under pressure**. That's the idea behind
those two questions, at least. Of course, you can try to play the system like
60% of other candidates who've heard the same advice, but you're missing the
point of those questions by doing so. By listing strengths masked as flaws,
you're simply telling the interviewer they can't take what you say/write at face
value, which is arguably putting you in a more challenging position because they
now have to exert additional effort to parse what you're _really_ like.

## Example

If I were applying for a senior software engineer or adjacent leadership role,
for instance, I might answer like this:

|Strenghts|Flaws|
|:-:|:-:|
|Planning|Experience managing people|
|Native/systems languages|Too passionate|
|Research|Code [not invented here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here)|
|Communicative|Communicative|

Note how each item connects directly to the role. I didn't mention my amazing
cooking skills or my chronically online vocabulary acqueintednitition. I also
haven't disclosed any personality traits beyond those that would affect my work
performance. Regardless of company size, the question gauges your fit within a
professional work environment, not a high school clique.

The last row shows that I understand the question... and that I'm very
"communicative"... sometimes to a fault even. But for a senior engineer, that's
a better problem than silence while the team drowns in uncertainty. In person
I'd clarify that I'm talkative when comfortable; otherwise, I tend to be more
reserved. Writing the same trait twice also provides comedic relief, which
grants me slightly more spotlight than some other grumpy-pants contestants will
get. **Bam!** Three flies with one row.

Planning and finding new solutions to problems (i.e. research) are crucial for
the role, and I'd fulfil that well, given that it's not a personal side project.

Lack of experience is a significant flaw for this position, although I believe I
can compensate with strong research skills and the ability to pick up new
knowledge quickly when motivated. I did run a successful craft business before
continuing my study, though I was only responsible for my own lack of sleep, so
that doesn't translate that well.

Being too passionate is the primary source of conflict. Years of FOSS
collaboration have taught me to explain, gracefully yet firmly, why someone is
completely and utterly wrong. Of course, if a subordinate refuses to budge,
things can get tricky.

All that doesn't mean I'm closed to feedback; I’ve learned to question myself
before raising issues with others. Experience would give me the wisdom to
resolve these situations more effectively. Until then, I'd have to lean on my
[INT stat](https://5thsrd.org/rules/abilities/intelligence/), peers and
management resources, such as books and articles - that's how you earn XP in the
first place, no?

Lastly, "Code not invented here" (NIH) is jargon for the tendency to sometimes
reinvent the wheel. While this trait can waste work hours on solutions that
already exist, it's also beneficial because it allows me to build up the
company's intellectual property and give it a competitive edge.

Any junior engineer can add a dependency (e.g. on [CEL](https://cel.dev)) and
call it a day. Still, if at any point the requirements surpass provisions
offered by the dependency, it's not as trivial to fork or build an alternative
from scratch. This is where that flaw flips into a strength - and a very
important one for a senior developer. A company that only ever glues together
third-party libraries isn't building any competitive advantage.

Planning, in contrast, helps me manage the NIH flaw: I always assess the state
of the ecosystem before the project starts, and collect resources needed to lead
the project to a conclusion (a successful one (hopefully)).

You can probably tell from my elaboration that this question goes way beyond a
simple good vs. evil dichotomy. It gives your application depth and showcases
the war scars that taught you lessons you can bring to your new role. That was
the point all along. Answering genuinely makes you stand out from those 60% of
losers who will only briefly touch upon why they're so great, as if the
interviewer isn't well aware that all the applicants are a perfect fit.

It's possible that whoever initially proposed to mask strengths as flaws
actually meant something along these lines, but the message got misconstrued
through generations of loretwisting and job coaching. So I guess, you're like
really lucky you've read this piece, you're welcome.
